### Setup virtual environment
Virtual environment is for isolated Python environments, which are more practical than installing packages systemwide. It also allows installing packages without administrator privileges.
```
py -m venv venv
```

Activate virtual environment.
```
venv/Scripts/activate.bat
```

Install Django
```
python -m pip install Django
```
